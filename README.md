# Machine-learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a set of artificial intelligence (AI) that is concerned with creating systems that learn or improve performance based on the data they use.
In the code `machine learning.py`I show how to create a simple machine learning code with **DecisionTreeClassifier**
to run this code we need to create a list of information in this case it is individualizable in the file 
I mainly used the library `asyncore`,`pyexpat`,`pandas`,`sklearn.tree`
